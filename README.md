## How to Install Maps in ATAK

To install the maps on your mobile device, follow these steps:

1. **Download the ATAK-Maps ZIP File**
   - Open the browser on your mobile device and go to the [ATAK-Maps GitHub Release page](https://github.com/joshuafuller/ATAK-Maps/releases).
   -    - Find the latest release and locate the `ATAK-Maps.zip` file within it.
   - Tap on the ZIP file to download it to your device.

2. **Locate the Downloaded ZIP File**
   - Once the download is complete, open the file manager app on your mobile device.
   - Navigate to the 'Downloads' folder or the location where your device saves downloaded files.

3. **Extract the ZIP File**
   - Find the `ATAK-Maps.zip` file in your file manager.
   - Tap on the file to extract it. Most mobile devices have a built-in feature to extract ZIP files. If your device doesn’t, you might need to download a file extraction app from your app store.
   - Extract the files to a known location. If prompted, choose to extract them to the `ATAK/imagery` folder on your device.

4. **Move the Extracted Files to the ATAK/Imagery Folder**
   - If the files were not directly extracted to the `ATAK/imagery` folder, you'll need to move them there.
   - In your file manager, navigate to the location where the files were extracted.
   - Select all the extracted files, then choose the 'Move' or 'Copy' option.
   - Navigate to the `ATAK/imagery` folder and paste or move the files there.

5. **Verify the Maps in ATAK**
   - Open the ATAK app on your device.
   - Check if the new maps are available in the map list or imagery folder.

If you encounter any issues, please check that you have the correct version of ATAK installed, and that you’ve placed the files in the correct folder. For further assistance, join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/dQUYADMW87).

**Note on Open Street Maps Compatibility**

We would like to inform our users that currently, Open Street Maps appears to be blocking access for the ATAK client. While this is an ongoing situation, we have decided to keep the Open Street Maps files included in our releases for posterity. We are actively monitoring the situation and hope to find a resolution in the future. In the meantime, we encourage our users to explore the other map sources available within ATAK-Maps. We apologize for any inconvenience and appreciate your understanding.
